## Overview

The frontend of Noteify is designed to offer a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and managing notes efficiently. It employs modern web technologies to ensure a seamless experience for users across various devices and screen sizes.


## Folder Structure

The frontend codebase of Noteify follows a structured layout for better organization and maintainability. Here's an overview of the main directories:

- `src/components`: Contains reusable UI components used throughout the application.
- `src/pages`: Houses higher-level components representing different views or pages.
- `src/styles`: Includes CSS files or stylesheets for styling components and pages.
- `src/assets`: Stores static assets such as images, fonts, or icons used in the application.

## Technologies Used

Noteify utilizes modern frontend technologies to deliver a responsive and intuitive user experience. Some of the key technologies used include:

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: Declarative routing for single-page applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.
- **axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making AJAX requests.

Tailwind CSS has been leveraged extensively for styling components and pages throughout Noteify. It offers a wide range of utility classes that enable rapid UI development with minimal custom CSS. This approach ensures consistency and flexibility in design while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.
